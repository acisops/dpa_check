Change Description
==================

Over time, the 1DPAMZT thermal model developed a tendency to over-predict the
temperatures at the hot end.  The primary goal of this re-calibration was to
eliminate those over-predictions.

In addition, the coefficient for the 2xx0 case was poor due to a very limited 
number of 2 chip observations (76 since 2019:001).  Consequently when analyses 
were carried out in order to assess the settling temperatures for various 
numbers of chips powered on, but not clocking, there was no discernible difference
between the 2 chip and 3 chip case. The value for the 2xx0 parameter was set
by hand to a more reasonable value (slides 28, 29, 30 and 31 of the TWG presentation).

A general re-calibration was accomplished as well.
