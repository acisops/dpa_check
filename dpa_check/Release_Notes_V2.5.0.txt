Change Description
==================

The previous update to the 1DPAMZT model focused on calibrating for
the Summer, 2019 cold season. It was stated that a new calibration
would have to be completed for the Fall hot season.  This
re-calibration addresses the variations across hot and cold seasons by
incorporating a different method of calculating solar heat effects due
to Earth's orbit.  This alleviated the need for seasonal
re-calibrations.

A general re-calibration was accomplished as well.
